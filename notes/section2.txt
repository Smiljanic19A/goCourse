5 important questions

1) How do you run go code
    go run file.go - this is the command to run any go file

    the go command is part of the GO cli and these are the key commands
    ===============================================
    go build        ->          Compiles a bunch of go source code files
        The output of this command is basically a .exe file
    go run          ->          Compile and execute one or two files
    go fmt          ->          Formats all the code in each file of the current directory
    go install      ->          Compiles and installs a package
    go get          ->          Downloads the raw source code of someone elses package
    go test         ->          Run any tests associated with the current project
    ===============================================

2) What does package main mean?
    Package == Project == Workspace
    1 package can have multiple files - and they are connected by the package statement at the top of the screen

    question - do all these files need to have a main entry point? (function and file)?

    2 types of packages

    1 - EXECUTABLE
        Generates a file which we can run
    2 - REUSABLE (basically a lib)
        Code used as helpers - basically where you would put reusable logic

    How do we define the difference?
        package main is reserved for executables!!!

        If the package is executable - when executed - we will automatically run the main function.

        package main ---> go build ---> main.exe
        package blabla ---> go build ---> nothing

        basically - use package main - only when you want to create an executable file


        every executable package MUST HAVE a main function.

3) what does import FMT mean
    Pretty self explanatory.

    fmt is used mostly for printing shit - like console.log or System.out

    Go has a bunch of built in packages - but by default - you do not have access to them unless you import them.

    Same for reusable packages that are not authored by go itself (external packages)

    all the standards packages have in depth docs at
    golang.org/pkg -> get acquainted with this page.

4) func?
5) How is main.go organized?
