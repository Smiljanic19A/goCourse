PROJECT 2

STRUCTS

project 1 had a very stupid thing - cards were a slice of strings - when in reality a deck is a slice of cards which has a value
and a suit.

To figure out the string or value - we would have to depend on string manipulation
Thats just straight out dumb.

Now we will make it with structs.

Struct
Collection of properties, related together.

Like card is a struct with suit and value
