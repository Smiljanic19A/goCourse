PROJECT 2

STRUCTS

project 1 had a very stupid thing - cards were a slice of strings - when in reality a deck is a slice of cards which has a value
and a suit.

To figure out the string or value - we would have to depend on string manipulation
Thats just straight out dumb.

Now we will make it with structs.

Struct
Collection of properties, related together.

Like card is a struct with suit and value

Defining a struct
type person struct {
	firstName string
	lastName  string
	age       int
}
INITIALIZING A STRUCT
	dude := person{
		firstName: "Dude",
		lastName:  "Mary",
		age:       25,
	}

U COULD ALSO JUST DO
	secondDude := person{"alex", "jognson", 33}

Zero values
    Very important
    Lets say we defined a struct like this
    var george person.
    The variable was declared but not initialized with properties - therefore Go by default gives it its
    "Zero values"
    type        zero value
    string      ""
    int         0
    float       0
    bool        false


type person struct {
	firstName string
	lastName  string
	age       int
}

func main() {
	var george person

	fmt.Println(george)
}

This code outputs
{  0}

fmt.Printf("%+v", george)
This outputs
{firstName: lastName: age:0}
