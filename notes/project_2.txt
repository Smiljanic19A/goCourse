PROJECT 2

STRUCTS

project 1 had a very stupid thing - cards were a slice of strings - when in reality a deck is a slice of cards which has a value
and a suit.

To figure out the string or value - we would have to depend on string manipulation
Thats just straight out dumb.

Now we will make it with structs.

Struct
Collection of properties, related together.

Like card is a struct with suit and value

Defining a struct
type person struct {
	firstName string
	lastName  string
	age       int
}
INITIALIZING A STRUCT
	dude := person{
		firstName: "Dude",
		lastName:  "Mary",
		age:       25,
	}

U COULD ALSO JUST DO
	secondDude := person{"alex", "jognson", 33}
