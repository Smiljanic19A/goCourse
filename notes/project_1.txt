We will create a cards package

CARDS
newDeck -> create a list of playing cards
print -> log out the contents of a deck of cards
shuffle -> shuffle the cards
deal -> create a new hand of cards
saveToFile -> save a list of cards to a file on the local machine
newDeckFromFile -> load a list of cards from a local machine


VARIABLE DECLARATION

Go is statically typed like Java or C++

BASIC GO TYPES (NOT AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST - research this)

TYPE        EXAMPLE
bool        true, false
string      "Hello"
int         0, -10000, 99999
float64()     10.000001, 0.00009, -100.003

Multiple ways we can do this

1 - var varname type = value
2 - varname := value -> this infers the type without declaring it explicitly. This can only be done when initializing the value.


FUNCTION RETURN TYPES
    If there is no return type defined explicitly - the function is considered void.
    If its not void - u have to explicitly define the return type

    example:
    func determineCardValue() string{
    	return "Ace Of Spades"
    }
